Call 2024-11-22 Lab 3 Velocity Addition

## Agenda

- Designing a Lab 3 to help new students get up to speed quickly on Relativistic Velocity Addition

- What screenshots would be helpful from the Spacetime Scenario: velocity addition.sce?

- Demonstration of Claude.ai (Taylor)



## Next Steps

* Justin> Make a new Document that will hold Lab 3, Google Drive is easy to share and collaborate on.
	Taylor's google account is:  taylor.brockman@gmail.com for document sharing.

* Justin + Brandon> Write a draft of the first section of Lab 3 instructions for the students.

The intention is to ask the student to use the Java software to make observations of time and distance from the screen, write them down in a table, change reference frames, and then do calculations based on those observations.   This was something they did in a previous lab.

The point of this first section is to show the students that the velocity numbers among the reference frames do not agree with the classic formulas:  v = v₁ + v₂   a   distance = rate * time

Approach to learning: “What do you think you’re going to get?” Then check and see the discrepancy.  
1.	Find velocity of bus relative to found, 
2.	Find velocity of bullet relative to bus.
3.	Predict bullet relative to ground.
4. 	Quantify the discrepancy to realize we need a different model.



Here's a rough draft of the steps the students would take:

1. Open animation: velocity addition.sce

2. Observe what’s on the screen in the Superhighway: clocks, tick marks

3. Advance time to find several different events, write down position and time coordinates in a table.

4. Do this for 3 reference frames: Earth, Space Bus, Bullet

5. Use the classic velocity calculation, do the math to determine the velocity of the bullet in each reference frame.


* Taylor> Next Step: More Illustrations:  1. Connect the mental model to a higher fidelity that overlays what you see on Spacetime Java.  Where are the clocks on the bus?

Free Illustration Software: Inkscape.

* Dr. Bennett> Share the notes from Previous Lab assigment on velocity addition.
