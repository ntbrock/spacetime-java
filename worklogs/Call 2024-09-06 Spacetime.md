## Agenda for next meeting on September 6, 2024

(Continue) 1. Lab Assignment - Discuss collected data from the animation and interpretation questions.
 
Specifically: Follow-up Question, 3: Find an example of two events that the train passenger observes to happen in one sequence, but the ground observer observes them to happen in the reverse sequence.


* Dr. Bennett - 2nd Lab Assignment to understand the Time Dialation and Length Contraction.


2. Java Code Review - Discuss reviewing the code to understand how the user interface functions. Java code is visible on Github: https://github.com/ntbrock/spacetime-java


* Next Session : Download, INstall IntelliJ Community Edition
https://www.jetbrains.com/products/compare/?product=idea&product=idea-ce

* Next Session: Clone the Git hub repository: clone via https
https://github.com/ntbrock/spacetime-java.git

* Next Session: Browse all the code, scenario files, the java files, the git history browse all that locally.


3. Github Accounts - Justin + Brandon create github user accounts, and Taylor adds you to the project as a collaborator.


* Next Session - Create account, add Brandon and Justin as Collaborators.




4. Trip to Alpha.sce - S1 and S2 Meaning - Dr. Bennett explains what S1 and S2 mean in the Trip to Alpha scenario.

* S2 

Next Friday 



## HOWTO Launch The Spacetime Jar on Windows (for Brandon)

1. Open the Explorer file browser that contains the Spacetime (1).jar.

2. Right click the empty space in the folder and chosse "Open in Terminal"

3. Run the command:

java -jar '.\Spacetime (1).jar'

or 

java -jar Sp<tab>


## Milestone Idea for Fall 2024 Semester

Goal: Build a technology demonstration using the latest web UI libraries that animates single spacetime scenario.

Scenario: Trip to Alpha.sce

### Getting started 

- Github for sharing code, peer review of code.

- Library review, feature comparison 

- React.js

- Libraries that make graphs or plot data:

- D3.js - Neat demonstrations of what it can do: https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery and https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/genuary-2022-3

- Language selection

- HTML, CSS, Browser Langauge - Javascript, typescript, or python??
- The Default is javascript, Other modern ones like Typescript
- Python running the browser?

### Feature Requirements

+F> Show all basic features of the animation "Trip to Alpha" in a web browser

+F> Move time forward + backwards. (Left and right)
 
+F> Move the rocket up and down the highway. (up and Down)

+F> Could start by using buttons, and then add the drag + drop capabilities.

+F> Object table + event table results should match the java version

+F> Graphic on the bottom as the time + rocket change.
