Call 2024-09-20 Spacetime Java on 9/20

## Next Actions

* Bennett> Add Spacetime diagrams into the Trainground Lab 1 + 2  Google Docs

* Taylor> Get my JUnit test working + Push pom.xml

* Justin + Brandon> Try a JUnit test in IntelliJ.  

Reference: https://symflower.com/en/company/blog/2023/how-to-write-junit-test-cases/


* Together Next Week> Review Spacetime code and see where we could write out a CSV file that has all the values of all the events.





## Agenda for September 20, 2024

0. Brandon Email - taylor.brockman@gmail.com


1. Physics - Trip to Alpha
 
* Read Tutorial - This is the resulting scenario from QUICK TUTORIAL in the HELP.
                Menubar > Help.  In the app.
 
X Dr. Bennett -

* Dr. Bennett - write the lab for Trip to Alpha
    A book with a Lab to do for Trip to Alpha?
    Did not find a lab written up, like the ones we did.
    Steps a person through the scenarios. Learning Physics while they're doing it.


Teaching the students how to draw the spacetime diagrams

Just talked about the super highway window.

In Train Ground, we just used the Superhighway.

* Idea - The Train Ground labs - add screenshots of each of the UI compoennts that are relevant to each of the questions.  


* Team - Convert lab 1 + lab 2 into Markdown files.

* Dr. Bennett - Share the Lab 1 and Lab 2 as Google docs as new copy.

Idea - Evolve into an interactive web page with diagrams instead of static screenshots.

2. Github Java Project – Git Pull + Push
 
= Justin + Brandon - Try to do a Git pull, see the newly added worklog/ Markdown files with all the notes.
 
= Justin + Brandon - do a simple text README or worklogs/ git commit and git push
 

Examplle of a git conflict:

CONFLICT (modify/delete): JustinPracticeCommit.md deleted in 0ca0b89f15d34e1a84a1347c3b619558028a7eff and modified in HEAD.  Version HEAD of JustinPracticeCommit.md left in tree.
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Advice - Small , more frequent commits.

git pull at the beginning of the day.

do at lesat 1 commit + push or more frequent is better!

use the git comments to talk thru detils.



Dr. Bennett's example:
```
commit 70c75fe66f99fedab09722fddc93ad6aba7aec29
Author: jrb32767 bennett@ncssm.edu
Date:   Fri Aug 2 14:56:35 2024 -0400
 
    Bennett practice commit
```
 
?? Unix -vs- Dos

Windows 11 > PowerShell as terminal and comand line iterpretter.

Git.exe  that is built for Windows/Dos.

New PowerShell, run git and see if I have the command available.







3. Java Unit Testing – Examples of a Java Unit Test Framework and Simple Tests

? Justin question Is Pom.xml created automatically or by hand?  Taylor walked through the structure from maven and how I wrote the dependencies.
