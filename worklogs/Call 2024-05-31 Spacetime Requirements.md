# Spacetime 

2024-05-31 Brockman + Bennett

## Summary

Cool software, love using it when I teach relativity.  Usable in curretn form.  Awesome project, for students to switch it over to run in a browser.

Big source code, chunked into modules created, different scenarios.  At least 20 scenarios.

GPT's may speed up the process.  Have tow sudetns working w/ in the fall, have java experience.


= Source code reviewed and compiling.
= Reviewed data structure of a 'scenario' file

## Requirements

- How will the students be using the software?  Webassign / Online homework?  In classroom? 

the end user - there's a website, make it public for physics educators and students, go to the website and run it in their browser from the site.

Not embedded in any other webassign.


- Will a set of Spacetime scenarios be created for the curriculum, or will students create their own scenarios? blank canvas?

Use the existing scnearios.  can yo umake your own scenarios.

John has just imported scenarios, light flashes + lcoks, toggling between different refrence frames, clock readings + position measurement of different events, and evetn table that lists. light flash 1 happens, heres the coordinates.

YES - Preexisitng set of SCE files.


stuleja.org/spacetime

Download the default set of scenarios

I like "Train Ground".

John Marry, F1, F2

Could start with an animator.




- Do students need the full capabilities to create clocks, light flashes?  Drag clocks? construct events?

- What could be added to the user interface to make it more applicable?
Hover-over output to a table?


1. Take the Source Code for one of the file, run it through a converter,

thoroguly test the new version.

* TB> Send Code in a Zip file.

Write unit tests.

John as a java developer.





- How can Talyor help the most?


1. students learn graphical program.

Checkin every 2 weeks. 

Andy = Ben

Doing 3 hours / week as work service.

want this to be their main project for entrie fall semester.

Fun friday afternoon activity.

Then in the fall start with Graphical programming fo rthe web.

Jon's Summer is flexible.
