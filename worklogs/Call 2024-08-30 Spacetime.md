Call 2024-08-30 Spacetime

## Agenda for next meeting on August 30, 2024
 
Shorter, 30 minutes, due to the extended weekend.

1. Lab Assignment - Discuss collected data from the animation and interpretation questions.

	The Lesson from Justin + Brandon - Simultianety

	Abstract plane each point position v origin, ex JOhn.
	Each point has a clock representign the time. 

	Simultaneous = Same time relative to John.  John and two parts of teh track.
	Clocks start at same time.


	S2 and S1 represents the different perspectives of Mary + John?  

	Impotant Lession -

	


2. Java Code Review - Discuss reviewing the code to understand how the user interface functions. Java code is visible on Github: https://github.com/ntbrock/spacetime-java

So far, Taylor and Dr. Bennett have each spent 6 hours and 4 meetings to explore the java code.

3. Github Accounts - Justin + Brandon create github user accounts, and Taylor adds you to the project as a collaborator.

4. S1 and S2 Meaning - Dr. Bennett explains what S1 and S2 mean in the Trip to Alpha scenario.
 

## HOWTO Launch The Spacetime Jar on Windows (for Brandon)

1. Open the Explorer file browser that contains the Spacetime (1).jar.

2. Right click the empty space in the folder and chosse "Open in Terminal"

3. Run the command:

java -jar '.\Spacetime (1).jar'

or 

java -jar Sp<tab>


## Milestone Idea for Fall 2024 Semester

Goal: Build a technology demonstration using the latest web UI libraries that animates single spacetime scenario.

Scenario: Trip to Alpha.sce

### Getting started 

- Github for sharing code, peer review of code.

- Library review, feature comparison 

- React.js

- Libraries that make graphs or plot data:

- D3.js - Neat demonstrations of what it can do: https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery and https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/genuary-2022-3

- Language selection

- HTML, CSS, Browser Langauge - Javascript, typescript, or python??
- The Default is javascript, Other modern ones like Typescript
- Python running the browser?

### Feature Requirements

+F> Show all basic features of the animation "Trip to Alpha" in a web browser

+F> Move time forward + backwards. (Left and right)
 
+F> Move the rocket up and down the highway. (up and Down)

+F> Could start by using buttons, and then add the drag + drop capabilities.

+F> Object table + event table results should match the java version

+F> Graphic on the bottom as the time + rocket change.
