## Trip to Alpha.sce Discussion

### Discussion 1 on 2024-09-06 

Vertical Lines represent events

S1 - nothing happening at position of earth - somebody reads the clock on earth.
Somebody stops that clock.

Alpha CLock reads 1.15 - the same as clock on earth.

Synchronized?  They read the same time.

Why can we have sycnchronized clocks?  They on the same line - represent velocity.

Top x-axis represetn position.  Y-axis is the speed traveling reference to the reference frame.

Alpha's state of motion relative to earth, is zero alphas' reference frame.
They're sharing the same refernce frame.

Brandon? Do earth and alpha both have the same mass?  Gravity also affects spacetime as well.  This animation doesnt' include - that's general relativity. 
This is a special relativity animation.

Assumption. every reference frame is moving at a constant velcit.y

No relative motion between alkpha and earth, share teh same reference frame.
Any clock on earth is sycnrhoized with alpha.


The rocket clock. Rocket is moving quickly, time is half of the time on earth.

Advances half as fast.

S1: Someone stopped the earth clock.
in the earth's refernce frame, is one instant according to Earth's clocks.

E2 - Turning event at Alpha, Rocket reaches alpha.

Rocket is still outbound,  tells us how much time it took for the earth.


Changed frame of reference to the rocket.

At the instant when the Rocket reaches Alpha,  the alpha clock says 4.61

but the earth clock says 1.15!

These are not equal.

Which clock started turning first and therefore advaces the most?

Alpha clock. shoudl read a later time.

the farher to the right the lcok is, the 

The Alpha clock got started too soon.

S1 happens to be simultaenous when the rocket reaches alpha according tot herocket's reference frame.  

Nothing to do with each other.  
No problem if we disagree.

THe inbound rocket refrence frame is different thant he outbound reference frame

measureing at an instance of time in tehg round refernc frame.

At S2, Earth reads 8.08, the rocet reads 4.04

Jumped to rocket frame.

Al the inboudn rocket rlocks read 404.

The 
S2 = Simultanous with turning event in the inbound frame

From rocket frame, earth clock reads 8.08
Rocket reads = 2.31

S2 happened simulateous with the beginnign fo the retrun trip.
Two different events and they're simulateous from the rockets return trip.

IUf you were to jump back to earths' reference frame.
the rocket is not at alpha.

How the time is perceived? 
This is not Time dilation as the 

Bennett - showing the rocket at th place in earth's refreence frame 
that's not the same place it's in the rocket's reference frame.

The big lesson of the first Lab 1.

Light takes time to get to places.

Time of events - at the same time bnuit int he train the first one hapened at the right most
left one 

How can two events in one refrence frame not be simulatenoius in another frame?
every reference frame has to measure time using a system of clocks, not just one clock.

different clock at efevery position.
Synchronizet he locks,t he only way we know they're working correctly.

Another reference frame in motion, 
From another ference frame, they'll say my clocks are not synrchronized. 

Earth and alpha are not synchronzied. 
earthy's clocks can't be synchronied.

S2 = someoen stops the earth clock at 8.08, 
in the rockets ref frame at the same instance, the rocket is about to depart.


3 different reference frames, outbound rocket, inbound rocket.
