Call 2024-11-15 Spacetime: Relativistic Velocity Addition

Taylor Zoom https://us02web.zoom.us/j/8437083840?pwd=MGkyeXIzMElDaE1vVm9xNzlDK0lEZz09
 
## Agenda

- Edwin Taylor Reading 3-11 and the Algebra
- Review of Spacetime Java scenarios/addition of velocities.sce
- Ideas around creating a Lab for Velocity Addition

	Two events that are simultaneous (same time) and simu-local (same point in space) must occur at the same time and same location in all reference frames. This is because the Spacetime interval is zero. A zero interval in any reference frame must be a zero interval in all reference frames.


## Lab R3: Relativistic Velocity Addition

- I liked how 3-11 Started with an impossibility.

- Start as a Google Drive Document, like Lab 1 and 2

- The first of a "notebook" type of interactive lab.


## Future: Jan Term Class, special relativity, Postponed.

Continue on this in the difference in the spring, help with labs for E+M class.

Continue part time.

Justin - interesting in continuing this after senior year.

Can we develop them.

What can we build between now and the sprig that helps the next generation of programmers. 


+ The labs are a great learning resource.

+ Code documentation.


## Recap of Progress

Brandon - Code + Equations, and learning about Velocity Additions.  Concept: parts of equations.

Justin - Went thru worldline records code, added comments to explain the equations.  The Video of the Loretnz, Email w/ PDF Reading.

Taylor - Edwin Taylor 3-11,  Did the algebra. FOIL Method.  Solved the equations.
