Call 2024-08-16 Introductions and Planning

## Agenda 

- Introductions, Justin, Brandon, Taylor

- Software Demonstration

Met once so far to setup the meeting Talked a bit about the project.

Virtual lab I wrote between now + next time, go through the lab to help familiarize what are the difference objects.


- Ideas on the first Technology Demonstration

- Get connected on Github


After - compiler parts

+ Installed spacetime locally, able to run it.
 
java platform Se binary app,  running .jar file 


## Next Steps + Agenda for next meeting on August 30, 2024

Shorter, 30 minutes, due to the extended weekend.

1. Lab Assignment - Discuss collected data from the animation and interpretation questions.

2. Java Code Review - Discuss reviewing the code to understand how the user interface functions. Java code is visible on Github: https://github.com/ntbrock/spacetime-java

So far, Taylor and Dr. Bennett have each spent 6 hours and 4 meetings to explore the java code.

3. Github Accounts - Justin + Brandon create github user accounts, and Taylor adds you to the project as a collaborator.

4. S1 and S2 Meaning - Dr. Bennett explains what S1 and S2 mean in the Trip to Alpha scenario.




## HOWTO Launch Jar from the template.

1. Open the Explorer file browser that contains the Spacetime (1).jar.

2. Right click the empty space in the folder and choosse "Open in Terminal"

3. Run the command:

java -jar '.\Spacetime (1).jar'

or 

java -jar Sp<tab>





## Definitions 

Event : Object is at a specific positision at a specifi time.


## Milestone Idea for Fall 2024 Semester

Goal: Build a technology demonstration using the latest web UI libraries that animates single spacetime scenario.

Scenario: Trip to Alpha.sce

### Getting started 

- Github for sharing code, peer review of code.

- Library review, feature comparison 

- React.js

- Libraries that make graphs or plot data:

- D3.js - Neat demonstrations of what it can do: https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery and https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/genuary-2022-3


- Language selection

- HTML, CSS, Browser Langauge - Javascript, typescript, or python??
- The Default is javascript, Other modern ones like Typescript
- Python running the browser?

### Feature Requirements

+F> Show all basic features of the animation "Trip to Alpha" in a web browser

+F> Move time forward + backwards. (Left and right)
 
+F> Move the rocket up and down the highway. (up and Down)

+F> Could start by using buttons, and then add the drag + drop capabilities.

+F> Object table + event table results should match the java version

+F> Graphic on the bottom as the time + rocket change.



## Meeting Cadence 

Every other week

As we get closer to the goal, more frequent meetings.

Honor the extended 

Start with Email.   taylor.brockman@gmail.com


* JB> Determine the S1 and S2 events and what they mean.

* TB> Begin an email thread with these notes, and 

* TB> Schedule another zoom for 2 weeks out - August 30th.

Shorter meeting, 30 minutes.



### Windows Installer Locations

Windows 11 ASIS.

## Map out the Fall 2024 Timeline and Student tasks

1. Understand history of development and experiences with the Tools + Languages.

2. Connect to Github project to share code.

3. Set up our development environments, INtelliJ Free / Student

4. Walkthrough of the Spacetime-java class + user interface structure from last week.

5. Background on the Physics to understand the Objects and what's on the graphs.

6. Unit Test + Automated Testing best practices and results on spacetime-java.

7. Strategies for decomposing the project into smaller steps - 1 event table with 1 event.

	Identify the minimal set of the classes, build a roadmap to make the problem smaller.
	Superhighway graph, make it show it and be able to move the event around.
	Spacetime diagram the bottom graph.

	Cut the problem in half.

	Take a specific scenario and display it out.

	Start with The simplest scenario and do a "technology demo". 


Connected: Java version for relatavistics January 2025  use in Morganton.
