Call 2024-08-16 Introductions and Planning

## Agenda 

- Introductions, Justin, Brandon, Taylor

- Software Demonstration

- Ideas on the first Technology Demonstration

- Get connected on Github
 

## Milestone Idea

Scenario: Trip to Alpha.sce

Build a technology demonstration using the latest web UI libraries that animates single spacetime scenario.

+F> Show all basic features of animation.

+F> Move time forward + backwards. (Left and right)
 
+F> Move the rocket up and down the highway. (up and Down)

+F> Object table + event table results should match the java version

+F> Graphic on the bottom as the time + rocket change.

+F> Could start by using buttons, and then add the drag + drop capabilities.




## Map out the Fall 2024 Timeline and Student tasks

1. Understand history of development and experiences with the Tools + Languages.

2. Connect to Github project to share code.

3. Set up our development environments, INtelliJ Free / Student

4. Walkthrough of the Spacetime-java class + user interface structure from last week.

5. Background on the Physics to understand the Objects and what's on the graphs.

6. Unit Test + Automated Testing best practices and results on spacetime-java.

7. Strategies for decomposing the project into smaller steps - 1 event table with 1 event.

	Identify the minimal set of the classes, build a roadmap to make the problem smaller.
	Superhighway graph, make it show it and be able to move the event around.
	Spacetime diagram the bottom graph.

	Cut the problem in half.

	Take a specific scenario and display it out.

	Start with The simplest scenario and do a "technology demo". 


Connected: Java version for relatavistics January 2025  use in Morganton.
