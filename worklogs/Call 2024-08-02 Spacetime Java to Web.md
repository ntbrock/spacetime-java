Call 2024-08-02 Spacetime Java to Web

Original Space Time

The java version was Tolejia , 2005.

Made the covnersion 

## Last Week

JB - Spent time looking at the package and how classes are called to do the functions. Good overview of the structure.

TB - Got the OK from the Java author to post the source code, new github repo that's free.  

## Agenda 8/2

Clone github repository, collaboration, issues, git diff

https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/10/clone-a-project-from-github/

Java build tool for libraries + unit tests
	* Taylor - commits, pushed, demo working next time we meet.

Historical paper on the original Spacetime

Continue exploration of the Spacetime Java program

Describe possible Web technologies to use for the conversion

	ECMAScript   proper name for the programming langauge that runs in browser.

	Similar syntax  { }  for blocks ,  functions with parameters.

	"The Java version of the spacetime when it wants to show a button or get a mouse event it's using the Built in Java from Swing."

	"When we move to Ecmascript, those are no longer available.  Instead, the graphical interface will use Html, and CSS that talks to Ecmascript."

Found that in spacetime-java the UI and Physics are tightly coupled.

Could we leverage UI / GPT technologies to facilitate the conversion


Map out the Fall 2024 Timeline and Student tasks
	- Go back to broader timeline from a few weeks ago.

1. Understand history of development and experiences with the Tools + Languages.

2. Connect to Github project to share code.

3. Set up our development environments, INtelliJ Free / Student

4. Walkthrough of the Spacetime-java class + user interface structure from last week.

5. Background on the Physics to understand the Objects and what's on the graphs.

6. Unit Test + Automated Testing best practices and results on spacetime-java.

7. Strategies for decomposing the project into smaller steps - 1 event table with 1 event.

	Identify the minimal set of the classes, build a roadmap to make the problem smaller.
	Superhighway graph, make it show it and be able to move the event around.
	Spacetime diagram the bottom graph.

	Cut the problem in half.

	Take a specific scenario and display it out.

	Start with The simplest scenario and do a "technology demo". 


## Milestone Idea



Scenario: Trip to Alpha.sce

Build as a technonlogy demonstrtion

+F> Show all basic features of animation.

+F> Move time forward + backwards. (Left and right)
 
+F> Move the rocket up and down the highway. (up and Down)

+F> Object table + eevent table reuslts match the java version

+F> Graphic on the bottom as the time + rocket change.



Connected: Java version for relatavistics January 2025  use in Morganton.
